# Natural Language Image Search with a dual encoder
This project builds a system that allows users to
search for images using natural language
descriptions.
We use a dual encoder deep learning model,
trained on the MSVD dataset, which pairs text
and images. By combining CNN-extracted image
features and transformer-based sentence
embeddings, our system bridges the gap
between vision and language, enabling intuitive
image retrieval with everyday sentences.
This method enhances search experiences in
fields like education, media, and e-commerce,
moving us closer to more intelligent, human-like
AI systems.
